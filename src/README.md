# COVID-19 Philippines Tracker Extension

This is a simple Google Chrome extension that fetches and displays up-to-date COVID-19 data for the **Philippines**, including total confirmed cases and reported deaths.

The data is sourced from the [disease.sh API](https://disease.sh/v3/covid-19/countries/philippines), which provides real-time coronavirus statistics from public sources.

- Displays confirmed COVID-19 cases and deaths in the Philippines
- Uses a modern JavaScript `fetch()` call to retrieve data
- Minimal popup design using Bootstrap Framework
- Lightweight and browser-friendly
